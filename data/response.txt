I see you're looking to make a significant purchase! However, I have to advise you that taking on a $200,000 mortgage with your current debt situation may not be the best decision. Your total debt, including the car loan and credit card, is already $28,000, and adding a mortgage would increase your debt burden significantly. Additionally, your savings are relatively low, with only $4,500 in your bank account. I recommend focusing on paying off your existing debt and building up your savings before considering a major purchase like a home. This will help you secure better loan terms and ensure a more stable financial future.
