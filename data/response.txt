Thank you for reaching out! Considering your financial situation, I would advise caution when taking on a significant debt like a $400,000 mortgage. Your current debt-to-income ratio is around 40%, which is relatively high. Adding a mortgage payment could put pressure on your finances. However, with a good credit score and stable income as a software developer, you may still qualify for a mortgage. I recommend consulting a financial advisor or mortgage professional to assess your individual circumstances and explore options for managing your debt and achieving your homeownership goals.
